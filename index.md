## About me

I am a Ph.D. student and graduate research assistant at the University of Utah. My research uses remote sensing data to study mountain glaciers in the Himalaya. I am interested in better understanding the variability of physical systems in the cryosphere with the goal of contributing to the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for downstream communities, to whom mountain glaciers are important water resources as well as potential hazards. 

### Skills & Experience

Processing and analysis of geospatial data, experience working with optical satellite imagery, synthetic aperture radar data and hyperspectral imagery. Experience working in python using modules including xarray, rioxarray, rasterio, geopandas, pandas, numpy, dask, pystac, stackstac & others. Processing geospatial data using gdal command line tools. Statistical modeling and data visualization in R. Version control wtih git and collaboration via github. 

### Other experience

`Summer 2022`
**National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Summer Internship in Parallel Computational Sciences (SIParCS)**, Boulder, CO, U.S.A.
During the summer of 2022 I had the opportunity to complete an internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research through the SIParCS internship program. This is a competitive internship program open to students at universities in the United States. The project that I worked on focused on the python package xarray, and supporting the goals of open, reproducible and accessible science. I developed tutorials and other educational resources that demonstrate using Xarray to work with remote sensing datasets, with a focus on cloud-hosted datasets, cloud-optimized data types and cloud-computing resources.
