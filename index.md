## About me

I am a Ph.D. student and graduate research assistant at the University of Utah. My research uses remote sensing data to study mountain glaciers in the Himalayas. I am interested in better understanding the variability of physical systems in the cryosphere with the goal of contributing to adaptation and mitigation strategies for downstream communities, to whom mountain glaciers are both important water resources and potential hazards. 

### Skills & Experience

**Python** - Processing and analysis of geospatial data, experience working with optical satellite imagery, synthetic aperture radar data and hyperspectral imagery. Experience using modules such as xarray, rioxarray, rasterio, geopandas, pandas, numpy, dask, pystac, stackstac & others. Working with cloud-optimized data types and cloud infrastructure including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Planetary Computer. I also have experience working with Spatio-Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC)-formatted data, including accessing STAC data from cloud repositories and creating STAC catalogs containing large volumes of geospatial raster data.  
**gdal command line tools** - Processing and manipulation of raster data  
**R** - Statistical modeling and visualization  
**git/github** - Version control and collaborative workflows, gh actions  
**QGIS** - Exploratory analysis of raster and vector geospatial data types, visualizing geospatial data  

### Research interests
Glaciers, glacier-climate connections, physical processes in the cryosphere, optical remote sensing, synthetic aperture radar remote sensing, sensitivity of the climate system to warming, climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, traditional knowledge systems and understandings of climate, environmental resources, resource management and hazards; open-source scientific software, open science principles, increasing accessibility and participation in scientific research. 

### Internships & other experiences
`Summer 2022`  
**National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Summer Internship in Parallel Computational Sciences (SIParCS)**, Boulder, CO, U.S.A.  
During the summer of 2022 I completed an internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research through the SIParCS internship program. This is a competitive internship program open to students at universities in the United States. My project focused on the python package Xarray, and supporting the goals of open, reproducible and accessible science. I developed tutorials and other educational resources that demonstrate using Xarray to work with remote sensing datasets, with a focus on cloud-hosted datasets, cloud-optimized data types and cloud-computing resources.

## Awards

`2022 - present`
**Future Investigators in NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) Fellowship, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)**

The fellowship grant supports tuition, academic expenses and living expenses for three years. 


## Publications

(*in revision*) Seasonal velocity differences between lake-terminating and land-terminating glaciers in the Langtang region of Nepal, **E. Marshall**, S. Rupper, R. Forster, S. Brewer & L. Stearns. *Scientific Reports*   

## Conferences & Meetings

`2023` 

**High Mountain Asia Team Research & Practice Dialogue meeting**, Kathmandu, Nepal  
This was a meeting organized by the Nepal Research & Development Institute (NDRI) and was attended by students and faculty from U.S. institutions as well as researchers at universities in Nepal, Nepal government agencies, and non-government organizations such as NDRI and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). The purpose of the meeting was to foster connections and identify areas for collaborative work on research topics including projections of future glacier change, glacier runoff contributions to seasonal water resources, hydroelectric power generation, forecasting of extreme precipitation events and glacier hazards such as glacial lake outburst flood events and landslides.
