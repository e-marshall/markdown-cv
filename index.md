## Currently

Ph.D. student and graduate research assistant at the University of Utah, using remote sensing data to study mountain glaciers in the Himalaya. I am interested in better understanding variability of physical systems in the cryosphere in order to contribute to the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for downstream communities, to whom mountain glaciers are important water resources as well as potential hazards.
