## About me

I am a Ph.D. student and graduate research assistant at the University of Utah. My research uses remote sensing data to study mountain glaciers in the Himalaya. I am interested in better understanding the variability of physical systems in the cryosphere with the goal of contributing to the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for downstream communities, to whom mountain glaciers are important water resources as well as potential hazards. 

### Skills & Experience

Processing and analysis of geospatial data, experience working with optical satellite imagery, synthetic aperture radar data and hyperspectral imagery. Experience working in python using modules including xarray, rioxarray, rasterio, geopandas, pandas, numpy, dask, pystac, stackstac & others. Processing geospatial data using gdal command line tools. Statistical modeling and data visualization in R. Version control wtih git and collaboration via github. 

### Other experience

`Summer 2022`  
**National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Summer Internship in Parallel Computational Sciences (SIParCS)**, Boulder, CO, U.S.A.  
During the summer of 2022 I had the opportunity to complete an internship at the National Center for Atmospheric Research through the SIParCS internship program. This is a competitive internship program open to students at universities in the United States. The project that I worked on focused on the python package xarray, and supporting the goals of open, reproducible and accessible science. I developed tutorials and other educational resources that demonstrate using Xarray to work with remote sensing datasets, with a focus on cloud-hosted datasets, cloud-optimized data types and cloud-computing resources.

### Research interests
Glaciers, glacier-climate connections, physical processes in the cryosphere, sensitivity of the climate system to warming, climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, incorporation of traditional knowledge systems about climate, resources and hazards, open-source scientific software, open science principles, increasing accessibility and participation in scientific research, optical and synthetic aperture radar remote sensing.

## Publications

(*in revision*) Seasonal velocity differences between lake-terminating and land-terminating glaciers in the Langtang region of Nepal, E. Marshall, S. Rupper, R. Forster, S. Brewer & L. Stearns. **Scientific Reports**    

## Conferences & Meetings

`2023` 

**High Mountain Asia Team Research & Practice Dialogue meeting**, Kathmandu, Nepal  
This was a meeting organized by the Nepal Research & Development Institute (NDRI) and was attended by students at faculty at a handful of U.S. institutions as well as researchers at univerisites in Nepal, Nepal government agencies, and non-government organizations such as NDRI and the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). The purpose of the meeting was to foster connections and identify areas for future collaboration. 

`2022`

**American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting**, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.  
[poster] "Preliminary examination of ITS_LIVE glacier velocity data for analysis of alpine glaciers in High Mountain Asia"  
[poster] "Accelerating cryospheric research with cloud-based, open source tutorials: Using Xarray to analyze ITS_LIVE ice velocity data and Sentinel-1 Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) backscatter imagery"     

**NISAR Community Science Meeting**, Pasadena, CA, U.S.A.  
[poster] "Educational resources for SAR in the Cloud: Monitoring backscatter variability of Himalayan proglacial lakes with publicly-accessible Sentinel-1 RTC data"  

**SciPy Conference**, Austin, TX, U.S.A.  
Co-instructed a tutorial on the python package Xarray  

`2021`

**American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting**, New Orleans, LA, U.S.A.

land-terminating glaciers in Langtang, Nepal"  

## Professional training

`August 2021`

**INSAR processing and time-series analysis for geophysical applications: ISCE,
ARIA-Tools, MintPy**  
UNAVCO, Inc.  
This course covered InSAR theories and InSAR processing with the JPL,Caltech InSAR
Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE) and time-series InSAR processing with
interferometric products.  

## Academic activities 

`2021-2022`
**Graduate student representative**  
*Geography Department, University of Utah*    
I attended monthly geography department faculty meetings as the representative of the graduate
student body. I was responsible for relaying questions and concerns from graduate students to
faculty and communicating relevant information to my graduate student colleagues.

`Fall 2021 - Summer 2022`
**Geography club co-president**  
*University of Utah*    
I organized events to promote both the geography department and geography as a field at the
University of Utah. We hosted Geography lunch hour where students could drop in with research
questions, as well as participatory mapping events and social events such as hikes.
